      <p>
        This will be a beautiful personal website written using Next.js,
        React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. It will consolidate
        lessons, achievements, and interests in one place.

        This website is a work in progress. I plan to have version one completed
        in January 2024.
